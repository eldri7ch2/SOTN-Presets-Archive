Welcome to the presets archive where we catalogue new versions, old versions, old presets that were abandoned, one-offs, challenge presets, and some that never got a fair chance. 

To install these, simply add the JSON to your SOTN Randomizer presets folder, then build it, and add the id to your Package.json. then you can generate it via Command Line and experience what might have been!
